## 🚀 About Me

I'm passionate about advancing artificial intelligence, especially in understanding and modeling time series data. Currently, I’m pursuing research toward a PhD, always exploring novel architectures that redefine how AI perceives sequential information.

I love digging into the latest papers on time-series, especially those applying Transformers, and I'm on the hunt for *the* breakthrough model that will reshape the field.
